# vibecode
1. Dark mode styling with vibrant accents
2. Mobile-first responsive design
3. Small font titles as requested
4. 1% margins (I'll use 24px padding to create edge-to-edge feel)
5. Vibe coding themes with gradient accents
6. Smooth animations and transitions
7. Proper spacing system using the 4px grid
